Finding and installing useful tools
===================================

We'll start by installing two useful tools for working with VOEvents in the
`Python`_ programming language. It's impossible to provide comprehensive
instructions for every possible operating system, but the good news is that
the tools are generally pretty easy to install. We'll discuss then general
principles, and provide step-by-step instructions for common platforms---you
should be able to adapt these to your own system.

Broadly speaking, there are two possible approaches you can take to getting an
appropriate set of tools on your system: you can either build & install them
yourself---the "conventional" way---or use some sort of prepackaged
environment which has everything you need already installed in it. This
document focuses on the first option, but includes a :ref:`brief discussion
<container>` of the second approach.

Background and dependencies
===========================

In general, we suggest relying on package management tools where possible,
rather than attempting to compile everything from scratch. For Python
packages, we'll use `pip`_; for system libraries, use a package manager
appropriate to your operating system (`APT`_ for `Debian`_, `Ubuntu`_ and related
systems; `Macports`_ or `Homebrew`_ on `OS X`_, etc). If you don't have
permission to use one of these systems, ask your system administrator nicely
(or, better, get yourself a cheap-as-chips VM from `Amazon EC2`_ or `Digital
Ocean`_ or similar).

Note that we depend on Python 2.7; not all of the tools described have yet
been ported to Python 3. This is unfortunate, but `you can help`_.

We suggest using `Virtualenv`_ to create an isolated environment for
installing the Python packages we'll need. That means you don't need any
special privileges, and you can blow the whole thing away and start over
when you make a mistake simply by running ``rm``.

In addition to Python, pip and Virtualenv, you will need to install `libxml2
and libxslt`_. You'll need the header files for `zlib`_ (the library itself
was almost certainly installed along with your operating system). You'll also
find `IPython`_ useful for following along with our examples. This is a good
time to look into package managers, as mentioned above. On Ubuntu `14.04.2`_::

  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev zlib1g-dev python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv ipython

Or with OS X using Macports, try::

  $ sudo port selfupdate
  $ sudo port install libxml2 libxslt python27 py27-pip py27-virtualenv py27-ipython

  # Use the software we've just installed as the default versions
  $ sudo port select python python27
  $ sudo port select pip pip27
  $ sudo port select virtualenv virtualenv27
  $ sudo port select ipython ipython27

Similar incantations should work on other systems. Next, create a Virtualenv
for working in and activate it. The name is arbitrary; call it whatever you
like::

  $ virtualenv voevent-venv
  New python executable in voevent-venv/bin/python
  Installing setuptools, pip...done.
  $ . voevent-venv/bin/activate

You will need to source the ``activate`` script in this way every time you
want to use this environment.

Reading and writing VOEvents: voevent-parse
===========================================

For manipulating the contents of VOEvents, we'll use the `voevent-parse`_
library. After you have set up and activated your Virtualenv, as above,
installing voevent-parse is easy using pip::

  $ pip install voevent-parse

The compilation will take a few moments. Then you can check if it is properly
installed by running::

  $ ipython
  [...]
  In [1]: import voeventparse

  In [2]: voeventparse.__version__
  Out[2]: 0.7.0

If you aren't familiar with the IPython shell, it's worth your while to spent
a few minutes getting used to it at this point.

This document will provide an introduction to using voevent-parse, but for the
full story you should refer to its `fine documentation`_.

Sending and receiving VOEvents: Comet
=====================================

For transmitting VOEvents using VTP, we'll use `Comet`_ (:ref:`Swinbank, 2014
<swinbank-2014>`). Installation proceeds in just the same way as for
voevent-parse::

  $ pip install comet

Unlike voevent-parse, Comet is not a library you will import into Python, but
is rather invoked through ``twistd``, a stand alone tool. You can check that
it is installed by running::

  $ twistd comet --help
  Usage: twistd [options] comet [options]
  Options:
    -r, --receive                   Listen for TCP connections from authors.
    -b, --broadcast                 Re-broadcast VOEvents received.
  [...]

It's also worth running the Comet test suite to check that everything has been
installed properly::

  $ trial comet
  comet.handler.test.test_relay
    EventRelayTestCase
        test_interface ...                  [OK]
            test_name ...                   [OK]
  [...]
  Ran 144 tests in 0.443s

  PASSED (successes=144)

All tests should succeed.

Again, this guide will cover the basics of using Comet, but it is well worth
your while to read `its documentation`_.

.. _container:

An alternative approach: containerization
=========================================

.. note::

   This section was contributed by `Casey Law`_.

Finally, you can use `docker`_ to quickly build all of the above for use in
a Jupyter (`IPython`_) notebook. Docker uses "containerization" (a kind of virtual
machine) to build entire operating systems and save you a lot of work.
If you choose to go this route, you'll need to `install docker`_. Then
download the Dockerfile for the `docker notebook`_ to an empty directory and
run::

  $ docker build -t notebook .
  $ docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -v ~/jupyter-notebooks/:/ipynb notebook

Note that ``~/jupyter-notebooks`` is a stand-in for the path to a place on
your file system where you'd like to save your notebooks. The ``docker run``
command start the Jupyter notebook server running the entire VOEvent
environment. You can find the notebook by pointing your browser at
http://192.168.59.103:8888.
